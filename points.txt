generic containers:
using #define to define containers of generic type
implement iterator for each of these containers
containers:
- vector
- list
- stack
- queue

find a way to run the functions of the generic containers properly

iterators can be used to decouple the containers and the algorithms

implement a few generic algorithms

consider generic functions later
